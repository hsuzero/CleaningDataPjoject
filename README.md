## Files ##
1. CodeBook.md - a code book that contains variables information,and how I clean up data set.
2. run_analysis.R - data prepared follow 5 steps as bellow:

    Step1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
    Step2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    
    Step3. Change Tidy.data code to activity description.
    
    Step4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    
    Step5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
3. FinaDoc.txt a text file describe the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
